# Smart-Waste-Segregation-System

Waste segregation is a crucial process in sustainable waste management, reducing the burden on landfills and diverting suitable waste to appropriate recyclable programs. Manual sorting, which can be labour-intensive and error-prone, should be avoided. Machine learning offers an automated solution to classifying waste into recyclable and non-recyclable objects. This research uses a multimodal approach, utilizing audio and visual data to build machine learning models. The dataset for this research was created by recording audio-visual data of both recyclable and non-recyclable objects being used as waste. The model was designed to analyse both modalities to achieve accurate results. This exhaustive approach aims to not only increase the accuracy and efficiency of waste management but also provide valuable insights to researchers interested in pursuing projects in this domain. The research was able to achieve an accuracy of 98.72%. Ultimately, this research aims to contribute to the advancement of sustainable waste management practices through the integration of cutting-edge technologies and data-driven insights.
